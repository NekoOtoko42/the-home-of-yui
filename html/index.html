            <p>Hello!  My name is Yui, though you probably know me by a different name, a name I do not wish to go by anymore.</p>
            <p>The reason for this is because I do not feel the name fits me, as a person, and is appropriate for who I am in terms of gender.</p>
            <p>In terms of gender, I am <a uk-tooltip="A gender that is not binary, aka using the outdated terms of male, or female.">non-binary</a>, more specifically I am more masculine than I am female, there are other contributions to my gender, but all that really matters to you is that I am closer to female than I am male, but I am not female or male.</p>
            <p>This means that, yes, I am trans, specifically <a uk-tooltip="a transgender person who typically was assigned male at birth (AMAB) but identifies fully or partially as a feminine gender.">transfeminine</a>, and I feel like I wish to go on <a uk-tooltip="Male to female hormone replacement therapy">mtf hrt</a> but that can be discussed later <a uk-tooltip="I guess">ig.</a></p>
            <p>Though I am not female (referenced as that is the gender these pronouns are most commonly used with), I still wish to go by the pronouns She/Her</p>
            <p>You may be having trouble understanding what a non-binary gender is, and that may be due to the fact you misunderstand the meaning of gender, if that is the case, then please consult this heavily researched publication <a href="https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/what-is-gender">The Gender Dysphoria Bible</a></p>
            <p>In terms of sexuality I am <a uk-tooltip="an orientation defined as the sexual attraction to all genders, though gender often still plays a role in one's attraction.">omnisexual</a>, I have dated men, women, and am comfortable with dating any gender</p>
